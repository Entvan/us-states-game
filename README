🗺️ U.S. States Game
This is a fun interactive game built with Python's turtle graphics module and pandas for data handling. The objective is to name all 50 U.S. states. When a correct state is entered, it appears on a blank map at its correct location.

🎮 How to Play
You'll be prompted to enter the name of a U.S. state.

If the guess is correct, the state name will be displayed on the map.

The game continues until all 50 states are guessed or you type Exit.

After choosing to exit with the same keyword, a file called States_to_learn.csv will be created, listing all the states you missed.
